/*
The categoriesgridregular dont need a title, and make it vertically scrollable along with the items so they also hide behind the header when scrolling, also use the same icons on the categories as were used on the explore page and add a little shadow for each button and make the icon and name of the category a little bigger.
The items should be centered, currently the left side of the items on the left has more margin than the right side of the items in the right. make it the same distance from the phone edge.
Add a price/week below the price/day, keep the distance in the same place (right side on below the card) add the item score on the right side below the distance.
